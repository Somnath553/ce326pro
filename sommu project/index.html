                        <p style="margin: 0;">
                            Rabindranath Tagore FRAS; born Robindronath Thakur, 7 May 1861 – 7 August 1941; sobriquet
                            Gurudev, Kobiguru, Biswakobi) was an Indian polymath - poet, writer, playwright, composer,
                            <span id="dots1">...</span><span id="more1">philosopher, social reformer and painter. He
                                reshaped Bengali literature and music, as well as Indian art with Contextual Modernism
                                in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Author of the "profoundly sensitive, fresh
                                and beautiful verse" of Gitanjali,[3] he became in 1913 the first non-European as well
                                as the first lyricist to win the Nobel Prize in Literature.[4] Tagore's poetic songs
                                were viewed as spiritual and mercurial; however, his "elegant prose and magical poetry"
                                remain largely unknown outside Bengal.[5] He is sometimes referred to as "the Bard of
                                Bengal".A Bengali Brahmin from Calcutta with ancestral gentry roots in Burdwan district
                                and Jessore, Tagore wrote poetry as an eight-year-old. At the age of sixteen, he
                                released his first substantial poems under the pseudonym Bhānusiṃha ("Sun Lion"), which
                                were seized upon by literary authorities as long-lost classics. By 1877 he graduated to
                                his first short stories and dramas, published under his real name. As a humanist,
                                universalist, internationalist, and ardent anti-nationalist, he denounced the British
                                Raj and advocated independence from Britain. As an exponent of the Bengal Renaissance,
                                he advanced a vast canon that comprised paintings, sketches and doodles, hundreds of
                                texts, and some two thousand songs; his legacy also endures in the institution he
                                founded, Visva-Bharati University.</span>

                            Munshi Premchand was born on 31 July 1880 in Lamhi, a village located near Varanasi
                            (Benares) and was named Dhanpat Rai ("master of wealth"). His ancestors came from a large
                            Kayastha <span id="dots2">...</span><span id="more2">family, which owned eight to nine
                                bighas of land.His grandfather, Guru Sahai Rai was a patwari (village land
                                record-keeper), and his father Ajaib Lal was a post office clerk. His mother was Anandi
                                Devi of Karauni village, who probably was also his inspiration for the character Anandi
                                in his Bade Ghar Ki Beti.Dhanpat Rai was the fourth child of Ajaib Lal and Anandi; the
                                first two were girls who died as infants, and the third one was a girl named Suggi. His
                                uncle, Mahabir, a rich landowner, nicknamed him "Nawab" ("Prince"). "Nawab Rai" was the
                                first pen name chosen by Dhanpat Rai.When he was 7 years old, Dhanpat Rai began his
                                education at a Madrasa in Lalpur, located near Lamhi.[8] He learnt Urdu and Persian from
                                a maulvi in the madrasa. When he was 8, his mother died after a long illness. His
                                grandmother, who took the responsibility of raising him, died soon after. Premchand felt
                                isolated, as his elder sister Suggi had already been married, and his father was always
                                busy with work. His father, who was now posted at Gorakhpur, remarried, but Premchand
                                received little affection from his stepmother. The stepmother later became a recurring
                                theme in Premchand's works.</span>

                            Joanne Rowling CH, better known by her pen name J. K. Rowling, is a British author,
                            philanthropist, film producer, television producer, and screenwriter. She is best known for
                           <span id="dots4">...</span><span id="more4"> writing the Harry Potter fantasy series, which has won multiple awards and sold more than
                            500 million copies, becoming the best-selling book series in history. The books are the
                            basis of a popular film series, over which Rowling had overall approval on the scripts and
                            was a producer on the final films. She also writes crime fiction under the pen name Robert
                            Galbraith.Born in Yate, Gloucestershire, Rowling
                                was working as a researcher and bilingual secretary for Amnesty International in 1990
                                when she conceived the idea for the Harry Potter series while on a delayed train from
                                Manchester to London. The seven-year period that followed saw the death of her mother,
                                birth of her first child, divorce from her first husband, and relative poverty until the
                                first novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was published in
                                1997. There were six sequels, of which the last was released in 2007. Since then,
                                Rowling has written several books for adult readers: The Casual Vacancy (2012) and—under
                                the pseudonym Robert Galbraith—the crime fiction Cormoran Strike series. In 2020, her
                                "political fairytale" for children, The Ickabog, was released in instalments in an
                                online version.</span>

                            Mitchell David Albom (born May 23, 1958) is an American author, journalist, and musician.
                            His books have sold over 39 million copies[2] worldwide. Having achieved national
                            <span id="dots5">...</span><span id="more5">recognition for sports writing in his early career, he is perhaps best known for the
                                inspirational stories and themes that weave through his books, plays, and films. Albom lives
                                with his wife Janine Sabino in Detroit.Albom was
                                born on May 23, 1958, to a Jewish family in Passaic, New Jersey. He lived in Buffalo,
                                New York for a little while until his family settled in Oaklyn, New Jersey, just outside
                                of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He grew up in a small, middle-class neighborhood which
                                most people never left. Albom was once quoted as saying that his parents were very
                                supportive, and always used to say, "Don't expect your life to finish here. There's a
                                big world out there. Go out and see it." His older sister, younger brother and he
                                himself all took that message to heart and traveled extensively. His siblings are
                                currently settled in Europe.[citation needed]While living in New York, Albom developed
                                an interest in journalism. Still supporting himself by working nights in the music
                                industry, he began to write during the day for the Queens Tribune, a weekly newspaper in
                                Flushing, New York. His work there helped earn him entry into the Columbia University
                                Graduate School of Journalism. During his time there, to help pay his tuition he took
                                work as a babysitter. In addition to nighttime piano playing, Albom took a part-time job
                                with SPORT magazine. Upon graduation, he freelanced in that field for publications such
                                as Sports Illustrated, GEO, and The Philadelphia Inquirer,and covered several Olympic
                                sports events in Europe – including track and field and luge – paying his own way for
                                travel, and selling articles once he was there. In 1983, he was hired as a full-time
                                feature writer for The Fort Lauderdale News and Sun Sentinel, and eventually promoted to
                                columnist. In 1985, having won that year's Associated Press Sports Editors award for
                                best Sports News Story, Albom was hired as lead sports columnist for the Detroit Free
                                Press to replace Mike Downey, a popular columnist who had taken a job with the Los
                                Angeles Times.</span>
